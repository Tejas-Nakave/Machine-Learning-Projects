## **`Title`**: Car Insurance Claim Analysis

### **`Overview`**:
The "Insurance Claim Occurrences Analysis of Cars" project aims to analyze patterns and trends in insurance claims related to car accidents. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to predict the likelihood of future claims, identify the key factors contributing to claims, and provide actionable insights to insurance companies for better risk management and policy optimization.

### **`Methodology`** :
1) Data Collection: Aggregating data from insurance claim records, traffic accident databases, weather data, and vehicle information.
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting statistical analysis and visualizing the data to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.
4) Feature Engineering: Creating new features to capture additional information that might influence insurance claims.
5) Model Selection and Training: Comparing multiple machine learning models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics.
6) Model Evaluation: Testing the model on unseen data and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
7) Deployment and Prediction: Implementing the model in a real-world scenario to predict future claims and assess risk.
8) Insights Generation: Analyzing model outputs to generate actionable business insights.
